# Grin data in pictures

# How does a grin transaction look like?

> **TAKE AWAY:**   
First, grin transaction data consists of ***inputs***,  ***outputs*** and a ***transaction kernel*** and a ***range-proof**. 
Second, transaction data can be aggregated [coinJoin, Dandelion, block, entire chain] at any point or time. This effectively means the grin blockchain can be considered one entire big transaction.   
Third, spend outputs can be freely forgotten thanks through *cut-through* in any of the aggregation steps. This **greatly improves anonymity and Scalability.** Add to this the fact that Grin outputs are blinded and you get an incredibly, lightweight, scaleble, and privacy preserving blockchain!
